### About The Project

I don't have the figma file so it is not pixel perfect. I have tried to make similar as same as possible. The website is responsive only 1440px and 375px screen sizes.

I have to use static json file for data because [the API](https://restcountries.com) no longer provide all countries request. [More info](https://gitlab.com/restcountries/restcountries/-/issues/265)
